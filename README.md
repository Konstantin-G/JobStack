# JobsStack
The Record of Jobs Applications
The program is made for store and managing database of jobs positions which I have applied for. 
Itâ€™s a JavaFX software which uses Apache Derby SQL database for storing jobs positions, 
Jsoup library for parsing webpage, YaHPConverter library for printing webpage to pdf and many other Java libraries.

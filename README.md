# JobsStack
The Record of Jobs Applications
The program is made for store and managing database of jobs positions which I have applied for. 
Itâ€™s a JavaFX software which uses Apache Derby SQL database for storing jobs positions, 
Jsoup library for parsing web page, YaHPConverter library for printing web page to pdf and many other Java libraries.
